Django provides the following class-based views to deal with authentication. All of them are located 
in django.contrib.auth.views:
    • LoginView: Handles a login form and logs in a user
    • LogoutView: Logs out a user
 Django provides the following views to handle password changes:
    • PasswordChangeView: Handles a form to change the user’s password
    • PasswordChangeDoneView: The success view that the user is redirected to after a successful 
password change
 Django also includes the following views to allow users to reset their password:

    with a token and sends it to a user’s email account
    • PasswordResetDoneView: Tells users that an email—including a link to reset their password—
    has been sent to them
    • PasswordResetConfirmView: Allows users to set a new password
    • PasswordResetCompleteView: The success view that the user is redirected to after successfully 
    resetting their password
